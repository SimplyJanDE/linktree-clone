Welcome to my Linktree clone repository! This project is a reimplementation of the popular social media linking platform using the React JavaScript library. The application features a simple and intuitive interface for displaying a list of links to various social media profiles. The layout adjusts dynamically to fit the size of the display, and the buttons are customized with logos and descriptions for each social media platform. 

 I hope you find this repository useful and feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions!
 
 Please note that the links to the social medias are links to my profiles. by the way, a follow is appreciated very much!:) So please embed your own links before using the link tree.
 
 Since I am a beginner programmer, this project is created with the help of Open AiÂ´s ChatGPT!
